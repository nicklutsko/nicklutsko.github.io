<h1>Carbon Tax versus Cap and Trade</h1>


<p>I’m curious to figure out which of these is the better option for trying to reduce emissions. My instinct is to support a carbon tax over cap and trade because I have a vague recollection of hearing a talk make this point. However, Paul Krugman actually favors cap and trade over a carbon tax, which seems like a good reason to support cap and trade.</p>

<p>Before getting started, we want to reduce emissions but we also want to somehow grow the world economy and help developing countries. There’s some thorny moral issues here, since developing countries likely won’t be able to emit as much as necessary in order to develop, like most developed countries did.</p>

<p>Also, plenty of people think both of these are bad options since neither will do enough to limit emissions. That’s very true, but they seem like the most likely options to be implemented in the near future and so I want to have an opinion on which is better.</p>
