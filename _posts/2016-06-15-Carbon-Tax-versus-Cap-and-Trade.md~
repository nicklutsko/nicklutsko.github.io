title: "Carbon Tax versus Cap and Trade"

<p>I’m curious to figure out which of these is the better option for trying to reduce emissions. My instinct is to support a carbon tax over cap and trade because I have a vague recollection of hearing a talk make this point. However, <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/27/the-textbook-economics-of-cap-and-trade/?_r=0">Paul Krugman</a> actually favors cap and trade over a carbon tax, which seems like a good reason to support cap and trade.</p>

<p>Before getting started, we want to reduce emissions but we also want to somehow grow the world economy and help developing countries. There’s some thorny moral issues here, since developing countries likely won’t be able to emit as much as necessary in order to develop, like most developed countries did.</p>

<p>Also, plenty of people think both of these are bad options since neither will do enough to limit emissions. That’s very true, but they seem like the most likely options to be implemented in the near future and so I want to have an opinion on which is better.</p>

<h2>Externalities</h2>

<p>From an economist’s perspective, climate change is an example of a negative externality. Externalities were first really discussed in Arthur Pigou’s 1920 book The Economics of Welfare. According to Wikipedia, Pigou (who I had never heard of) was a good friend of Keynes, though they often disagreed, and a great economist -- he’s not as well remembered as he should be.</p>

<p>Externalities are basically the spillover from an activity. An example is if a chemical plant releases its wastewater into a nearby river. The key thing about an externality is that it affects people not participating in the activity, like people downstream of the chemical plant. There can also be positive externalities: if you have work done on your house to make it more attractive you increase the value of your neighbours’ houses as well as your own.</p>

<p>Carbon taxes and cap and trade are both ways of dealing with a negative externality by implementing a Pigouvian tax, which is a tax on an economic activity that generates a negative externality. The theory behind it is quite neat.</p>

<img src="marg_ben.png" alt="Marginal Benefit" style="width:304px;height:228px;">

<p>To take a concrete example, suppose we draw a graph of the marginal benefit you get each month from driving your car versus how how many hours per month you spend driving your car. The blue line in the figure gives an example in which these are linearly related (it seems like people always assume a linear relationship, at least in textbook examples). Intuitively, it makes sense that driving two hours a month gives you a lot more benefit than not driving at all, but driving 16 hours a month doesn’t get you much more than driving 14 hours a month. So the marginal benefit is much bigger going from 0 hours to 2 hours than going from 14 hours to 16 hours.</p>

<p>Eventually driving for too long actually reduces the additional benefit you get from your car (because you spend too much on gas, waste too much time in the car, etc.) and the marginal benefit is negative. Conventional economic thinking is that economic actors increase their usage until the marginal benefit is zero.</p>

<p>The idea of a Pigouvian tax is to make an economic activity more expensive so that the marginal benefit goes to zero faster. This effectively moves the x-axis on the graph further up the y-axis (dashed line). The tax revenue (shaded in red) helps pay for the negative effects of driving your car. In a cap and trade system the “tax” comes from businesses paying for the emission permits. The area between the red rectangle and the marginal benefit line is “lost benefit”, which has to be taken into account when setting the Pigouvian tax rate.</p>

<h2>Krugman’s Arguments</h2>

<p>Krugman points out that both cap and trade and carbon taxes function in this way. However, when thinking about cap and trade, the x-axis is emissions whereas with a carbon tax the x-axis is cost. So with cap and trade we directly control the emissions whereas with a carbon tax we control the cost of the emissions. Hence cap and trade is a more direct way of reducing emissions, which is what we want to do. In both cases, the tax revenue can be used to help people deal with the consequences of climate change.</p>

<p>One thing to note is that Krugman cites some studies which show that the lost benefit is actually quite small under most cap and trade proposals (presumably this doesn’t change with a carbon tax). These calculations don’t even include the estimated benefit to the environment of reducing emissions, so the lost benefit really doesn’t seem to be something we have to worry about.</p>

<p>The other argument in favor of cap and trade over carbon tax is that it has already worked: sulfur dioxide emissions have been significantly reduced because of a cap and trade system. As Krugman says, this shows that cap and trade can work in practice, despite its issues.</p>

<h2>Counter Arguments</h2>

<p>Krugman’s logic makes a lot of sense but I think there are three counter-arguments in favor of a carbon tax. Before getting to these, people often claim that cap and trade will create a market for emission permits, which can then be exploited by clever finance-types. But emission permits ideally would be fairly straight-forward and so wouldn’t be susceptible to scams and other ways of exploiting knowledge asymmetries. Large companies and banks would probably figure out some ways of taking advantage of a cap and trade system, but they’d do the same thing with a carbon tax.</p>

<p>Anyways, my first concern is the complexity of implementing cap and trade. There are so many questions which would have to be addressed: what the total cap is, how big the individual permits are, whether permits come in different sizes (e.g one size for individuals and one for companies), how to regulate trading, etc. Again, cap and trade was successfully implemented for sulfur dioxide emissions, but carbon dioxide emissions are a completely different scale. Every part of an economy would be affected and would have to be considered, which makes cap and trade seem like a formidable legislative operation.</p>

<p>The second and third issues are related and are ways in which cap and trade seems to hurt start-ups and small businesses more than well-established companies. Analogously, developing countries would probably be hurt more than industrialized countries.</p>

<p>This might seem counter-intuitive, since big industries/wealthy countries are the worst polluters. But remember that they also have more cash reserves and better credit ratings, making it easier to get loans. Suppose a start-up comes along that has a way of making Coca-Cola with half the emissions of the actual Coca-Cola plants. Before it can make even one bottle, it has to pay for the permits for the carbon it will emit, on top of all the other start-up costs. I don’t know much about how start-ups work, but this seems like it would make it more likely for the start-up to fail. On the other hand, with a carbon tax small businesses or developing countries would at least be able to get the benefit from their emissions before paying the tax.</p> 

<p>Similarly, since we don’t control the cost of carbon under cap and trade it’s possible that less established companies or countries would be priced out of getting new permits. It might actually be in the interest of big companies/wealthy countries to drive up the price of carbon to discourage competition. Less established companies would also be more susceptible to swings in the price of carbon. Either way, competition/innovation/development seems to be discouraged.</p>

<h2>Wrap-up</h2>

<p>It would be great if either one of these was implemented on a large scale. As Krugman writes, they both provide good incentives to reduce emissions and at least a somewhat morally fair way of reducing the effects of negative externalities. Right now, I tentatively lean on the side of carbon tax. Implementing cap and trade seems overwhelming from a legislative perspective, and I suspect some things would fall through the cracks. And, while I don’t worry about permits being used dishonestly, I do worry that they would benefit larger companies more than smaller ones and developed countries more than developing countries. I’m not an economist though, so I’m happy to change my mind.</p>

<p>There are some other related and interesting concepts and questions. For instance, the “social cost of carbon” can be used to price carbon, say for a carbon tax. Calculating this cost is probably quite an interesting exercise. I’m also curious how exactly the emissions of a given company/person/etc. are measured. I’d imagine that this is typically quite opaque, and wouldn’t be surprised if it was pretty inaccurate.</p>
