<p>The <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f247/b8fae38e0c46bb9d1020b0be0d589db28446.pdf">Jevons paradox</a> is a counterintuitive effect in which an increase in the efficiency with which a resource is used results in an increase in the consumption of that resource. The English economist Willan Stanley Jevons first described the paradox in his 1865 book <i>The Coal Question</i>, where he pointed out that James Watt's improved steam engine design, which made the coal-powered steam engine much more efficient as an energy source, led to increased coal consumption, as the steam engine was widely adopted by industry.</p>

<p>This is a major issue in environmental economics because it means that making things more fuel efficient results in more fuel being used. An example is energy-efficient light bulbs. Suppose one bulb provides 10$/hour of benefit ("utility") and two bulbs provide 15$/hour of benefit. If the cost of keeping a bulb lit is 6$/hour then the net utility of one bulb is (10 - 6 = ) 4$/hour and the net utility of two bulbs is (15 - 12 =) 3$/hour. But if improvements in electricity mean that you only need 4$/hour of electricity to keep the bulb lit then it makes more sense to use two bulbs, since you get (15 - 8 = ) 7$/hour of utility versus (10 - 4 = ) 6$/hour of utility with one.</p>

<p>This <i>rebound effect</i> is the key to the Jevons paradox. Conventional economic thinking assumes that reducing the cost of something increases the demand for it. If the demand increases rapidly with a reduction in price -- if the demand is "elastic" -- then an increase in efficiency increases the net consumption and we have the Jevons paradox. On the other hand if the demand doesn't increase much even with a big reduction in price (the demand is inelastic) then consumption decreases. There's also an indirect effect, since savings in one area (bulbs) can be used to pay for something else (more air conditioning, for instance).</p>

<p>This is a microeconomic argument, focusing on individual consumers. There's also a macroeconomic argument: more efficient energy use is good for the economy, stimulating resource consumption.</p>

<p>So are technology-driven improvements in efficiency ultimately bad for the environment? It all depends on the size of the rebound effect, which is extremely difficult to measure and so there are people on both sides of the argument (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421508007428">large rebound effect</a>, <a href="http://environment.yale.edu/gillingham/GillinghamRapsonWagner_Rebound.pdf">small rebound effect</a>). When I think about me and the people around me, demand seems to be pretty inelastic, probably because people are irrational: they replace an inefficient bulb with one efficient bulb, not two. But this is obviously a very small sample size.</p>

<p>Governments, corporations, etc. generally ignore the Jevons paradox, blindly pushing for improvements in energy efficiency, but this is actually another reason to implement caps and/or taxes on resource consumption. In fact it makes sense to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800996000778?via%3Dihub">tax improvements in efficiency</a>, and Jevons himself realized that government interventions, whether through taxes or through hard caps, were needed to control coal consumption.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00991778/document">This</a> is an interesting paper showing that Jevons paradox is less relevant for water consumption than for energy consumption because water consumption is often very inelastic, constrained by water availability more than price.)</p>
