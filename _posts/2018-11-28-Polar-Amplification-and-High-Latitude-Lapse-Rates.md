The Arctic warms faster than anywhere else on Earth when CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations are increased. This is seen in observations, comprehensive climate models and in idealized models, but we still don't have a great understanding of what causes this polar amplification of warming. One reason for this is that different processes are responsible for polar amplification in idealized models than in more realistic model, so it's hard to create ``simple" models of polar amplification.

Two obvious candidates for causing arctic amplification are the ice-albedo feedback and the Planck feedback. The ice-albedo feedback is just that sea-ice cools the high latitudes by reflecting incoming solar radiation, so if ice melts because of global warming the high latitudes experience enhanced warming. The Planck feedback comes from the fact that black bodies emit radiation as temperature to the fourth power $(T^4)$. Thus cooler regions have to warm up more than warmer regions to compensate for the same forcing.

But neither of these turns out to be that important. The Planck feedback is actually quite weak, and ends up being overwhelmed by the forcing, which is tropically-amplified. If the Planck feedback was the only feedback on CO<sub>2</sub> forcing, warming would actually be tropically amplified.</p>

The ice-albedo feedback plays a bigger role, but two analyses (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo2071.pdf">Pithan and Mauritsen (2014)</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0339-y.pdf">Stuecker et al. (2018)</a>) of CMIP5 models have found that -- in climate models -- the lapse-rate feedback contributes the most to polar amplification. This is negative in the tropics and positive at high latitudes: at low latitudes lapse-rates decrease, so the surface doesn't have to warm as much to maintain energy balance at the top of the atmosphere, while at high latitudes lapse-rates increase, so the surface has to warm up more.

We understand the low latitude part of this well. Temperature profiles at low latitudes follow moist adiabats. When the surface warms up the profiles shift to warmer moist adiabats, with smaller lapse-rates. The high latitude part is more difficult to understand.

Tim Cronin and Malte Jansen showed that the high latitude troposphere is in radiative-advective equilibrium, with radiative cooling balanced by poleward energy transport (<a href="http://web.mit.edu/~twcronin/www/document/PayneJansenCronin2015.pdf">here</a> and <a href="http://web.mit.edu/~twcronin/www/document/CroninJansen2015.pdf">here</a>). This suggests that changes in polewards energy transport are important for the large positive lapse-rate feedback. But Stuecker et al. recently did an experiment in which CO2-like forcing is only applied at high latitudes, and found that this gives a strong positive lapse-rate even though the change in horizontal energy transport is weak $($and in the opposite direction from under global warming$)$.

This suggests that local processes are enough to give a large positive lapse-rate feedback. But then, it's useful to bring in some other information: we know that polar amplification is mostly localized to near the surface, and it mostly happens in the wintertime. Finally, in winter there is generally a near-surface inversion of Arctic temperatures. The black line in panel a of the Figure shows temperatures averaged over 65$^\circ$N from a pre-industrial simulations with GFDL's CM3 model.

How is this inversion set-up? In winter the high latitudes don't get any insolation, so apart from some downwelling long-wave radiation from the atmosphere, there's nothing to heat the surface. But the surface does emit radiation, so it can cool rapidly. Over the ocean temperatures are pinned to the freezing temperature, but over ice they can get very low. Higher up, the atmosphere is optically thin, so it cools more slowly, resulting in an inversion $($<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-013-1964-9">ref</a>$)$.

In other words, inversions will mostly be found over land and over sea-ice, but not over open water. This is shown in panel b of the Figure, which plots temperature profiles averaged over open water in blue and over ice in gray from the same simulation. There's a hint of an inversion over the water, but it's much more well defined over the ice.

If sea-ice melts then the Arctic-averaged profile will look more like the open water profile, with a weaker inversion (red curve in panel a). In a conventional feedback composition, this looks like a positive lapse-rate feedback, but this seems a bit deceptive. Physically, the warming is caused by melting of sea-ice.

<a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1029/2012GL051598">Screen et al. (2012)</a> did experiments with two different models in which they kept greenhouse gas concentrations fixed, but forced the models with observed monthly Arctic sea-ice and SSTs from 1979 to 2008. This produced a strong wintertime warming, localized to the near-surface. This is probably partly due to the ice-albedo feedback, but also because of this apparent lapse-rate feedback.

High latitude lapse-rates are sensitive to radiative forcing, surface warming and atmospheric energy transports, but the conventional feedback decomposition is deceptive, as the erosion of  can look like a large high latitude lapse-rate feedback.
