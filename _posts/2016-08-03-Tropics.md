<p>Ignoring large-scale motions $($waves, hurricanes, etc.$)$, the tropical atmosphere can be pictured as containing fast, narrow updrafts of moist air; with the air slowly subisiding everywhere else. Water vapor condenses out as the air rises, forming deep clouds -- here's a nice <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6oHLiVtPnQ">animation</a> of two simulations of this.</p>

<p>In the updrafts the air follows a moist adiabat, with its temperature decreasing by $\sim$6.5Kkm$^{-1}$. This temperature profile is quickly communicated to the rest of the atmosphere, so that on average the whole tropical atmosphere follows a moist adiabat. However, when the air descends in the clear-sky region it tries to follow a dry adiabat, i.e its temperature decreases by $\sim$10Kkm$^{-1}$. This would make the air too warm to be in equilibrium with the environment and so the adiabatic heating is balanced by radiative cooling $($the emission of long-wave radiation by the subsiding air$)$.</p>

<p>Assuming that the temperature is constant in time, this balance can be written using the thermodynamic energy equation as
$$
c_p\frac{T}{\theta}\frac{\partial\theta}{\partial z} M = -Q_c
$$ 
where $c_p$ is the heat capacity of air, $T$ is temperature, $\theta$ is potential temperature, $M$ is the net upward mass flux in the clouds $(ignoring precipitation, entrainment, etc. what comes up must come down$)$ and $Q_c$ is the radiative cooling rate in the clear air.</p>

<p>This is an important relationship; understanding what sets the different terms tells us about how tropical atmospheres work, and also about how they will respond to future climate changes. Below are examples of each of these.</p>

<h2>A Simple Explanation for the Area of Convective Updrafts</h2>

<p>$M$ is determined by the area of the updrafts $(\sigma_{cl})$, the speed of the updrafts $(w)$ and the density of the rising air $(\rho)$:
$$
M = \sigma_{cl} w \rho.
$$ 
<p>Focusing on $\sigma_{cl}$, we know that the updrafts take place in a small fraction of the domain. This asymmetry is an interesting feature of moist convection: in classical Rayleigh-Bernard convection the area of updrafts is the same as the area of descending motion. So the presence of water vapor changes the dynamics significantly. 

Bjerknes actually gave an explanation for this in a 1938 paper, which still seems to be a useful intuitive starting point  (<a href=http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic1031576.files/Bjerknes_1938.pdf>this</a> is a summary). For air to rise it has to be warmer than its surroundings (it has to have positive buoyancy). Letting $T_{cl}$ be the temperature in the cloudy updraft and $T_c$ be the temperature in the clear downdraft, then for the updraft to gain buoyancy over time $\frac{\partial T_{cl} - T_c}{\partial t}$ must be larger than zero.</p>

<p>In a cloudy updraft the temperature equation gives (now assuming temperature is not constant in time)
$$
\frac{\partial T_{cl}}{\partial t} = w_{cl}(\Lambda_e - \Lambda_m)
$$ 
where $\Lambda_m$ is the moist adiabatic lapse rate and $\Lambda_e$ is the environmental lapse rate. In the clear region
$$
\frac{\partial T_c}{\partial t} = w_{c}(\Lambda_e - \Lambda_d)
$$ 
where $\Lambda_d$ is the dry adiabatic lapse rate. 

Since $\Lambda_e - \Lambda_m$ is greater than zero, and $w_{cl}$ is positive we want $w_{cl}$ to be large so that $T_{cl}$ increases rapidly. Conversely, $\Lambda_e - \Lambda_d$ is less than zero, as is $w_c$, and so $w_c$ must be small for $T_c$ to increase slowly.

If we assume that mass is approximately conserved then $M_{cl} \sim M_c$. Furthermore, if the density of the air is roughly constant, then since $w_{cl}$ is larger than $w_c$, $\sigma_{cl}$ must be small compared to $\sigma_c$. As is shown in the notes linked to above, this can be done more carefully algebraically. In Kerry Emanuel's Atmospheric Convection book there's also a more rigorous derivation of this using buoyancy frequencies.


<h2>FAT</h2>

<p>One important consequence of equation 1 is the Fixed-Anvil-Temperature (FAT) hypothesis. First put forward by <a href="http://www-k12.atmos.washington.edu/~dennis/Hartmann_Larson_2002GRL.pdf">Hartmann and Larson (2002)</a> (which I think was inspired by some results from <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2000GL012833/abstract">Hartmann et al. (2001)</a>), it is probably our best constraint on the behavior of clouds in the tropics, and seems to do well in both <a href="http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~kuang/Kuang&Hartmann2007.pdf"> models</a> and in <a href="http://www.atmos.washington.edu/~dennis/Zelinka_HartmannJGR11.pdf">observations</a>. </p>

<p>The FAT hypothesis says that the "spreading out" of large convective clouds (forming <a href="https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/A_Classic_Anvil_Cloud_Over_Europe.jpg/300px-A_Classic_Anvil_Cloud_Over_Europe.jpg&imgrefurl=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulonimbus_incus&h=200&w=300&tbnid=cQvrvsGH38-F_M:&tbnh=160&tbnw=240&docid=Xj2J-On_9nnJQM&usg=__ORZOhUvA6jfd0XyosYQbW57ZfxM=&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjxw-DNz43OAhWh1IMKHTP7AMwQ9QEIIDAA">the anvil</a>) always happens at the same temperature. Reasons why important. </p>

<p>To understand why this is the case, start by assuming the radiative cooling profile ($Q_c$) is roughly constant up to some height just below the tropopause, at which it quickly goes to zero. In this region the subsidence must also be small (since $Q_c$ is small there must also be less radiative heating) and so the rising air must spread out at this height, forming the anvil. Another way of stating the FAT then is to say that $dQ_c/dz$ is largest at a fixed temperature. </p> 

The starting point for the FAT hypothesis is the assumption that water vapor is responsible for most of the radiative cooling in the clear regions. We can assume that this cooling is roughly constant up to the height at which water vapor can no longer absorb or emit energy to space efficiently. In this region the subsidence must also be small (since there's less radiative cooling there must also be less adiabatic heating).</p>

<p>The water vapor stops being able to absorb and emit energy efficiently because the water vapor saturation vapor pressure decreases exponentally with temperature. This is a consequence of the Clausius-Clapeyron law and we also have to assume that the relative humidity is roughly constant. With this, the water vapor will always stop absorbing/emitting at the same temperature, rather than, say, a given height. I'm not sure why saturation vapor pressure is so important. The emission is due to the rotational bands of the water molecules, so either the emission of these bands is proportional to the amount of water vapor or the emission decreases just because there's less water vapor.</p>
