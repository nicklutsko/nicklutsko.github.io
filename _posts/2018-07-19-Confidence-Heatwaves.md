title: "Why are We Confident Heatwaves are Caused by Global Warming?"

<p>It's been a rough summer, with heatwaves all over the northern hemisphere. Arctic temperatures have gone over 90&#x2109;, leading to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/18/sweden-calls-for-help-as-arctic-circle-hit-by-wildfires">forest fires near the Arctic circle</a>. Along with this, there have been articles in the press <a href="http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-stokes-heat-wave-media-climate-change-20180715-story.html">linking the heatwaves to climate change</a>, and the heat is even <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/11/heatwave-climate-change-americans-survey">convincing more people of the reality of climate change</a>. I'm normally wary of attributing individual events or even seasons to climate change, but people are pretty confident that climate change is making heatwaves more frequent and more severe. There are also lots of attribution studies linking increased frequency and severity of heatwaves to global warming, and even claiming that individual heatwaves are caused by global warming (Some examples: ).</p> 

<p>Another way of seeing our confidence that recent heatwaves are the result of anthropogenic global warming is <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/mapped-how-climate-change-affects-extreme-weather-around-the-world">this map of extreme events</a> from Carbon Brief, which also shows whether they can be attributed to climate change. The criterion for events being attributable to climate change is a bit sketchy, but if you just filter for heatwaves you can see that the vast majority can be attributed to climate change. Other extreme events, like storms and droughts are less often attributed to global warming.</p>

<p>So why can we be so confident that recent heatwaves have been caused by global warming? I think there are three main reasons. The first two are that (1) we generally have good records of temperature and (2) that climate models do a reasonable job of reproducing these temperature distributions. Long, reliable records of temperature means that we can trust the statistics, and in particular that we have a sense of the internal variability, while (2) means that we can trust studies which use climate models to do attribution. Some other important extreme events like hurricanes and droughts are both much rarer and much harder to simulate: global climate models can just barely resolve hurricanes.</p>

<p>The third reason comes from a point made in a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo2253.pdf">2015 Nature Geoscience Perspective</a> by Ted Shepherd: increasing CO$_2$ concentrations is a thermodynamic perturbation to the climate system. This means that every aspect of climate change that we are confident in comes from thermodynamics, whereas impacts that come from changes in the dynamics of the atmosphere are less robust, because increased greenhouse gas concentrations only affect the dynamics indirectly through the temperature.</p>

<p>Atmospheric dynamics affect temperatures, but thermodynamics has a bigger impact on temperatures. In contrast, the dynamics of the atmosphere is a stronger control on precipitation, another quantity we care a lot about, though warmer temperatures do allow the atmosphere to hold more water, so we expect more rain in a warmer world. Figure 2 of the perspective illustrates this difference by showing that there's much more confidence (in the sense of model agreement) in projected temperature changes than in projected changes in precipitation.</p>

<p>Shepherd is mostly concerned with changes in the mean, but the same ideas apply to extreme events. When we talk about heatwaves we usually mean extended periods of time when temperatures are above some threshold, so if the whole distribution of temperatures shifts, we would expect to cross this threshold more often. Extreme precipitation events usually happen in storms (e.g., the winter storms we get in the northeast), which are part of the atmospheric circulation and whose changes under global warming are complex. For instance, the storm-tracks in mid-latitudes -- where most of the storms happen -- are expected to shift polewards, which might in turn affect the strength of the storms (which is proportional to the latitude of the storm tracks). </p>

<p>Going back to hurricanes, we expect these to get stronger because a warmer atmosphere can hold more water, but as far as I can tell the jury is still out on how the frequency of hurricanes will change. Since we also don't have records of many very strong hurricanes and we can't simulate them well in global models, it's hard to say whether a particular hurricane has been influenced by climate change.</p>

<p>We also have issues with droughts because we haven't actually observed very many, though there were periods of "mega-droughts" in the American southwest during the Medieval period. And droughts involve complex land processes and land for years. We seem to be confident that droughts in <a href="http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/advances/1/1/e1400082.full.pdf">the American southwest</a> will get worse, but the signal is <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jgrd.50206">less clear in the Sahel</a>. Based on the Carbon Brief map there seems to be some disagreement on whether the California droughts were influenced by climate change.</p>

<p>A simpler problem is actually forest fires, since these just require an extended period of warm temperatures and low precipitation. Human influence was found for both fire events on the Carbon Brief map, and presumably the Arctic fires can also be linked to human-induced climate change.</p>

<p>If instead of increasing CO$_2$ concentrations we were applying some kind of dynamic perturbation to the climate system, then it would be easier for us to link particularly strong storms to human influence. We might also be able to directly influence hurricanes by changing atmospheric dust, and land-use changes could be changing the frequencies of droughts, though my understanding is we don't understand these well enough to say for sure. But because we're increasing CO$_2$ concentrations, we can be confident that heatwaves will continue to get worse and happen more often. Changes in the atmospheric circulation, sea surface temperature variability and land-use will also affect heatwaves but heatwaves are still one of the clearest signs of a changing climate.</p>
