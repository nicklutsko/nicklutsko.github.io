<p>People often talk about how we’ve locked in a certain amount of warming: even if we were to immediately stop emitting CO2, the planet would keep warming up, for a little while at least. This is because the climate system responds to perturbations on several different time-scales, some of them quite long. It will also take a long time for atmospheric CO2 levels to return to pre-industrial values. This is an argument for reducing emissions as quickly as possible, but a related question I haven’t seen much discussion of is: how many emissions are we locked in for?</p>


<p>What I mean by this is that, assuming we don’t want to tank the global economy and revert to being hunter-gatherers, we will have to emit CO2 to transition to a carbon neutral society. Think about replacing every coal and natural gas power station with wind turbines, building electric vehicles to replace all of our current fossil-fuel powered vehicles, changing our land use practices so they don’t emit any net CO2, etc.  These transformations would require emitting a significant amount of CO2.</p>

<p>This could be called the “carbon inertia” of our society, and I haven’t seen it mentioned anywhere. For instance, some of the “wedges” which Socolow and Pacala suggest are (1) increasing wind electricity capacity by ten times relative to today, and (2) increasing solar electricity capacity by a factor of a hundred relative to today. These are both worthwhile goals, but as far as I can tell they don’t take into account how much carbon would be emitted building all these wind turbines and solar cells.</p>

<p>In the worst case, we would have to burn all available fossil fuels just to get to the point where our civilization is carbon neutral. In a slightly better case, it would be possible to go through with this transformation while leaving a significant amount of carbon in the ground, but this would require the process to be highly optimized. It’s hard to imagine countries successfully co-ordinating and co-operating to the extent that this would require. In the best case, of course, we would be able to overhaul our energy infrastructure without emitting too much CO2.</p>

<p>Calculating our carbon inertia is hard. It would be do-able if we had perfect integrated assessment models and so could explore how optimized the transformation would have to be. But to give an order of magnitude estimate, let’s take the increasing wind capacity by a factor of ten wedge. This estimate says that the lifecycle emissions of wind-turbines is about 12 g CO2-eq / kWh. We need to go from a capacity of about 60 TWh to about 6000 TWh. The total emissions are thus:<br>
5940 x 10<sup>12</sup> x 12 / 10<sup>3</sup> / 10<sup>6</sup> = 71.3 Mtons CO2-eq.<br>
Given that annual CO2 emissions are about 10 Gtons, this is encouraging.</p>

<p>As another example, Socolow and Pacala propose doubling the average fuel efficiency of cars from 30mpg to 60mpg. Presumably, this would mean replacing all the inefficient cars with more efficient ones. Suppose instead we replaced them with electric cars, which had zero emissions. About 10% of a normal car’s lifetime emissions come while it is being built. Suppose we decided, today, to replace every low mileage care on Earth with an electric car, and that manufacturing an electric car produced the same emissions as manufacturing a regular car (in fact electric cars often have slightly higher emissions). There are about 1 billion cars in the world and we can use an estimate of 20 tons CO2-eq as the emissions required to build a car. Replacing all the cars in the world would thus require 20 Gtons CO2-eq, which is roughly the same order of magnitude as annual CO2 emissions.</p>

<p>So we have estimates ranging from about 1% of annual global CO2 emissions to 100% annual global CO2 emissions for the different wedges. Taken together, ten years seems like a reasonable estimate of our carbon inertia. That is, if we wanted to immediately transition to a carbon-neutral economy, we would probably still have to emit about 10 years’ worth of CO2, on top of our regular emissions (which, to be fair, would probably be decreasing over the course of the transition). This actually seems quite reasonable, and suggests that a carbon neutral economy might be quite attainable.</p>
