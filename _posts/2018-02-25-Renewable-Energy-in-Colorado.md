<p>This article gives a sense of how fast the renewable energy industry is developing. In 2016, Excel Energy, Colorado's biggest utility company, released a proposal to shut down two coal power plants and replace them with roughly 55% renewables and 45% natural gas by 2023. They then put out a solicitation to private developers to make bids to meet these demands. </p>

<p>The article analyzes a report on these bids Excel issued at the end of 2017. Developers only make bids that they are confident they can supply, so the report is a clear snapshot of the state of the industry (in Colorado), without being clouded by politics or public relations. In total, there were 430 bids for 238 separate projects, whereas in 2013 a similar solicitation only got 55 bids. More important is how cheap the bids were: the median bid for a wind project was $18.10/MWh (+$3 for storage) and the median bid for solar was $28/Mwh (+$7 for storage). Both of these are <i>much</i> cheaper than expected, and are actually cheaper than conventional electricity generation by coal plants in Colorado.</p>

<p>This is just one, relatively small, project, but it gives a sense of how quickly renewable energy is becoming economically competitive with coal, with the relatively cheap cost of storing it being particularly important. The article ends with an interesting point. The relative costs of renewables and fossil fuels vary region-by-region, but in places like Colorado where renewable energy is cheaper than fossil fuels, and where renewables are allowed to compete with fossil fuels, renewables quickly becomes the dominant energy source. This allows renewable energy suppliers to scale-up their businesses and rapidly drive down their costs in a self-reinforcing cycle. Measures of average energy prices don't account for these rapid price decreases in renewable-dominated regions, making renewable energy production seem much expensive than it actually is.</p>
