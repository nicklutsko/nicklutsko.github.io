	<p class="ex"><font size=3>My research has two main themes: <i>(1)</i> improving our understanding of the large-scale circulation of Earthâ€™s atmosphere, and <i>(2)</i> studying the climate system holistically in order to better predict how it will respond to increased CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. I am also interested in climate issues more broadly, including climate model development and evaluation, ocean heat uptake and climate variability on all time-scales. One theme in my work is an emphasis on using idealized models to capture key features of more complex systems, with the goal of connecting results from these idealized models to observations and comprehensive climate models.</font></p>
