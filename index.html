	<p class="ex"><font size=3><b>Postdoctoral Associate</b> in the Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences at MIT, working with Professor <a href="http://web.mit.edu/~twcronin/www/">Tim Cronin</a>. Previously I was in the Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences program at Princeton, where I completed my PhD with Professor <a href="https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/isaac-held-homepage/">Isaac Held</a>.</p>

	<p class="ex"><font size=3>My research has two main themes: <i>(1)</i> deepening our understanding of the large-scale circulation of Earthâ€™s atmosphere and <i>(2)</i> studying the climate system holistically in order to better predict how it will respond to increased CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. I am also interested in climate science more broadly, including climate model development and evaluation, ocean heat uptake and climate variability on all time-scales. One overarching theme in my work is an emphasis on using idealized models to capture key features of more complex systems, with the ultimate goal of connecting results from these systems to observations and to comprehensive climate models.</font></p>

	<p class="ex"><font size=3>I will be starting as an <b>Assistant Professor</b> at the <a href="https://scripps.ucsd.edu/">Scripps Institution of Oceanography</a> in January 2020. Please get in touch if you are interested in graduate student or postdoc opportunities, or any other collaborations!</font></p>
