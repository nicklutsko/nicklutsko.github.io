	<p class="ex"><font size=3><b>Assistant Professor</b> of Climate Science at the <a href="https://scripps.ucsd.edu/">Scripps Institution of Oceanography</a>. 

	<p class="ex"><font size=3>I am interested in a broad range of climate questions, with a general focus on the large-scale dynamics of Earth's atmosphere and on developing a better understanding of how the climate system will respond to increased CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. A common theme in my work is an emphasis on using theory and idealized models to capture key features of more complex systems, with the goal of connecting to observations and comprehensive climate models. Recent topics of interest include climate sensitivity, temperature variability, heat stress, monsoons and solar geoengineering.</font></p>

	<p class="ex"><font size=3>Outside of my primary research, I enjoy working on projects at the intersection of art and climate science. This includes taking part in an <a href="https://www.artnews.com/art-in-america/interviews/visualizing-climate-change-michael-wang-nick-lutsko-1202681918/">Exchange</a> with artist <a href="https://michaelwang.info/">Michael Wang</a> for Art in America, working on the <a href="https://vimeo.com/266553400">Emerald Tutu</a> project and collaborating with the sl Collective architecture firm.</font></p>

	<p class="ex"><font size=3>I am actively recruiting graduate students and postdocs, so please get in touch if you are interested in working together. In particular, I am looking for a postdoc to work on how coupling between tropical ocean and atmospheric dynamics affects monsoons, please see <a href="images/Monsoon_job_posting.pdf">here</a> for more details. I am excited to build a creative, hard-working and inclusive group at Scripps.</font></p>
