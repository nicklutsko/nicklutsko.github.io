	<p>Postdoctoral Associate at the Massachussetts Institute of Technology Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences at MIT, working with Prof. <a href="http://web.mit.edu/~twcronin/www/">Tim Cronin</a>.</p>

 <p>Ph.D. Princeton University, Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences program, supervised by Prof. <a href="http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/isaac-held-homepage">Isaac Held</a>.</p>

	<p>The main goal of my research is to improve our understanding of the atmosphere by connecting results from idealized models to the behavior of comprehensive climate models and to the observed behavior of the atmosphere. I am also interested in climate science more generally, including the problem of climate sensitivity, climate model development and evaluation, ocean heat uptake and climate variations on all time-scales.</p>
