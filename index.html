	<p class="ex"><font size=3><b>Postdoctoral Associate</b> in the Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences at MIT, working with Prof. <a href="http://web.mit.edu/~twcronin/www/">Tim Cronin</a>. Previously I was in the Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences program at Princeton, where I completed my PhD with Prof. <a href="https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/isaac-held-homepage/">Isaac Held</a>.</p>

	<p class="ex"><font size=3>The main goal of my research is to improve our understanding of the atmosphere by connecting results from idealized models to the behavior of comprehensive climate models and to observations. I am also interested in climate science more generally, including the problem of climate sensitivity, climate model development and evaluation, ocean heat uptake and climate variability on all time-scales.</font></p><br />
