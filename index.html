	<p class="ex"><font size=3><i>Postdoctoral Associate</i> in the Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences at MIT, working with Prof. <a href="http://web.mit.edu/~twcronin/www/">Tim Cronin</a>. Ph.D. Princeton University, Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences program, supervised by Prof. <a href="http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/isaac-held-homepage">Isaac Held</a>.</font></p>

	<p class="ex"><font size=3>The main goal of my research is to improve our understanding of the atmosphere by connecting results from idealized models to the behavior of comprehensive climate models and to the observed behavior of the atmosphere. I am also interested in climate science more generally, including the problem of climate sensitivity, climate model development and evaluation, ocean heat uptake and climate variability on all time-scales.</font></p>

	<p class="ex"><font size=3>I find that writing helps me understand things, so on the <a href="http://nicklutsko.github.io/notes/">Notes</a> page are posts on topics in climate science as well as on other environmental issues which interest me. Scripts I have written as part of my research are available to download on the <a href="http://nicklutsko.github.io/code/">Code</a> page.</font></p><br2>
