## Can we just capture all US emissions?

[var name:"emissions" value:6 /]
[var name:"cost" value:100 /]
[derived name:'total' value:`emissions*cost` /]
[derived name:'defense' value:`emissions*cost/600 * 100` /]
[derived name:'clean' value:`emissions*cost / 60 * 100` /]


As of 2014, the United States emits about **[display var:emissions format:"d" /]** billion tonnes of CO2 each year. Suppose it cost [Dynamic value:cost min:5 max:500 step:5 format:"d"/]  dollars per tonne of CO2 to do direct air capture. To capture the entire annual CO2 production from the US would cost about   **[display var:total format:"d" /]** billion dollars.

The annual budget of the US Defense department is **600** billion dollars, and the cost of complying with the Clean Air Act is **60**  billion dollars. So capturing all US emissions would cost **[display var:defense format:"d" /]**% of the Defense budget, or **[display var:clean format:"d" /]**% of Clean Air compliance.
