			<h2>"1-Dimensional" 2-layer QG Model</h2>
			<p>Stand-alone Python code for a "1-dimensional" 2-layer QG model described in <a href="http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/bibliography/related_files/rlp8801.pdf">Panetta and Held (1988)</a>. The model is truncated in wavenumber space to retain only the zonal-mean flow and one non-zero zonal wavenumber (the default set-up retains the most unstable wave) and can be quickly run on a laptop. Non-linear terms are de-aliased using the Orszag (1971) "two-thirds" rule. The domain is doubly-periodic and the model is forced by an unstable meridional temperature gradient and by lower-layer Ekman friction. Note that all variables are non-dimensionalized.</p>
