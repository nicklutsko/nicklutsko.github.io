			<h3>Binning Data by &omega;<sub>500</sub> Velocities</h3>
			<p><font size=3>Function to bin data by &omega;<sub>500</sub> velocities, as done by <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-003-0369-6">Bony et al. (2004)</a> and many others.</font></p>

			<h3>Multi-Taper Spectral Analysis</h3>
			<p><font size=3>This script includes functions to compute the power spectrum of a signal and to perform a coherence analysis of two time-series using the multi-taper method. These are basically just Python versions of the Matlab functions available from <a href="http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~phuybers/Mfiles/index.html">Peter Huybers' website</a>. Requires the <a href="http://thomas-cokelaer.info/software/spectrum/html/contents.html">spectrum</a> Python module.</font></p>

			<h3>Eddy Flux Co-Spectra</h3>
			<p><font size=3>Function for calculating eddy flux co-spectra, following method of <a href="https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jmsj1965/49/2/49_2_125/_article">Hayashi (1971)</a> (see also <a href="http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0469%281991%29048%3C0688%3APSSOTE%3E2.0.CO%3B2">Randel and Held (1991)</a>). Includes functions to calculate space-time cross-spectra and phase-speed cross-spectrum.</font></p>

			<h3> 2-layer QG Model</h3>
			<p><font size=3>Stand-alone, parallelized Python script for a 2-layer quasi-geostrophic model. The domain is doubly-periodic and, out of the box, the model is forced by interacting with a zonally-uniform mean-flow, as well as by surface friction and radiative damping, following <a href="http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/bibliography/related_files/rlp8801.pdf">Panetta and Held (1988)</a>, but this can be easily changed. Non-linear terms are de-aliased using the Orszag (1971) "two-thirds" rule and note that all variables are non-dimensionalized.
