	<h1>Research Interests</h1>
	<p>Since coming to Princeton I have mostly been working on problems in idealized atmospheric dynamics with my adviser, Professor Isaac Held. These problems have involved connecting the low frequency variability of atmospheric systems to their linear responses, for example by using the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem. Besides this work, I am also interested in climate science more generally, from ocean biogeochemistry to atmospheric radiative transfer, as well as the societal problems involved in adapting to the effects of climate change.</p>
