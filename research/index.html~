			<h1>Research</h1>
			<p>Since coming to Princeton I have mostly been working on problems in large-scale atmospheric dynamics. The dynamics of the troposphere can be separated quite cleanly (at least outside the tropics) into the problem of understanding the zonally-symmetric circulation and the problem of understanding the zonally-asymmetric circulation. I have worked on both problems, using idealized models such as the Phillips 2-layer QG model and the GFDL dry dynamical core, with the unifying theme being connecting the low-frequency variability of these systems to their linear responses.</p>
