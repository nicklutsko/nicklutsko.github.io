			<h2>Research</h2>
			<h3>Large-scale dynamics</h3>
			<p><font size=4>Outside of the tropics, the dynamics of the troposphere can be separated into the problem of the zonally-symmetric circulation and the problem of the zonally-asymmetric circulation. I have worked on both problems using a variety of idealized models, like the Phillips 2-layer quasi-geostrophic model and the GFDL dry dynamical core; with a particular focus being connecting the models' internal variability to their linear responses. Where possible I compare my results with observational data.</font></p>
			<h3>Climate sensitivity</h3>
			<p class="indented"><font size=4>I have investigated the connection between comprehensive climate models' internal variability and their sensitivity, which could provide a new "emergent constraint" on Earth's sensitivity. A related question is understanding models' behavior on different frequencies, which is relevant for future climate changes as well as past variations of Earth's climate.</font></p>
