			<h1>Research</h1>
			<p>The dynamics of the troposphere can be separated (at least outside the tropics) into the problem of understanding the zonally-symmetric circulation and the problem of understanding the zonally-asymmetric circulation. Since coming to Princeton I have worked on both problems, using idealized models such as the Phillips 2-layer QG model and the GFDL dry dynamical core, with the unifying theme being connecting the low-frequency variability of these systems to their linear responses.</p>
			<p>I am also interested in climate science more generally, including things like the problem of climate sensitivity, climate model development and evaluation, ocean heat uptake and climate variations on all time-scales. In a recent project I have tried to relate the internal variability of CMIP5 models to their sensitivity.</p>
