			<h2>Research</h2>
			<p>My work so far has mostly focused on the large-scale dynamics of the troposphere, which can be separated (outside the tropics) into the problem of the zonally-symmetric circulation and the problem of the zonally-asymmetric circulation. I worked on both problems using a variety of idealized models, like the Phillips 2-layer QG model and the GFDL dry dynamical core, and have also compared my results with reanalysis data and other observational products.</p>
			<p>I am also interested in climate science more generally, including the problem of climate sensitivity, climate model development and evaluation, ocean heat uptake and climate variations on all time-scales. This research involves using a combination of simple box models, state-of-the-art climate models and observations.</p>
