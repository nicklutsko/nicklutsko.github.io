			<h1>Research</h1>
			<p>Since coming to Princeton I have mostly been working on problems in large-scale atmospheric dynamics. The dynamics of the troposphere can be separated quite cleanly into the problem of understanding the zonally-symmetric circulation and the problem of understanding the zonally-asymmetric circulation. The zonally-symmetric circulation is dominated by the eddy-driven jet and so this part of atmospheric dynamics is dominated by theories for eddy fluxes. Studies of the zonally-asymmetric circulation generally focus on stationary waves.  </p>
